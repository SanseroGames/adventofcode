# Advent Of Code 2019

In this advent of code we tried to solve every day in a different challenge.

| Day | Language  |
|-----|-----------|
| 1   | Minkolang |
| 2   | Lolcode   |
| 3   | Cobol     |
| 4   | Lisp      |
| 5   | PHP       |
| 6   | Bash      |
| 7   | Lua       |
| 8   | LaTex     |

## Remarks

### Day 4

We first looked at **LeGit**. It is a brainfuck clone with git repos. But Legit only treats 
numbers as numbers when they are hardcoded - otherwise, they're ASCII.

Then we tried to solve the challenge in **Chef** but that language did not support 
rounging or casting to int so the challenge was not solvable (or a real pain to try to solve).

### Day 8

We first wanted to solve the challenge in **Velato**, a language written in midi files, but the
language cannot read from standard in and it does not support arrays, so encoding 15000 numbers
in an integer is not feasable.
