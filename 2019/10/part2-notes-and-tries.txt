Solution explanation

The problem with Excel-formulas is that you cannot really create a loop. Also depending on values that have been calculated previously only really works when referencing other cells which were precalculated. 

So I use 200 tables for each iteration to find out which coordinate is destroyed at position 200.

A table has 4 components

|---------------------------|-----------|
| Each cell holds the angle | Min angle |
| in respect to station     | for each  |
| 0 is on top               | row       |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| Min angle for each column | lowest angle > last angle which is closest to station
|---------------------------|-----------|
| X to delete, Y to delete, last angle  |
|---------------------------------------|

In each new table iteration the field that has been determined to delete in the last table is cleared. then the next field is searched that has a bigger angle than the one found last

Once we reach the highest still available angle in the field we start again at an angle of 0Â°



Old solution

=IF(
    AD29="#"; // there is an asteroid
    (
        COLUMN(AD29)-1-$AJ$3 // X coordinate relative to station
    )/(
        GCD(
            ABS(
                ROW(AD29)-1-$AJ$4
                );
            ABS(
                COLUMN(AD29)-1-$AJ$3)
            )
        ) & "," & (
            ROW(AD29)-1-$AJ$4 // y coordinate relative to station
        )/(
            GCD(
                ABS(
                    ROW(AD29)-1-$AJ$4 
                    );
                ABS(
                    COLUMN(AD29)-1-$AJ$3
                    )
                )
            ) & " - " & (
                (ROW(AD29)-1-$AJ$4) / (COLUMN(AD29)-1-$AJ$3)
            )
        ;
        ""
        )
